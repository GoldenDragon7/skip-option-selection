# My Approach to this Project.

First i had a look at how the current page looks and decided on a approach that would be easy to use with both mobile and desktop users (I unfortunately did not have the time to get to mobile optimisation).

I then also decided i would not try to copy the navbar of the current site since that would mess valuable time (and you only asked to redesign the Skip selection).

Once i did a bit of planning i started by creating the react project. i then downloaded the sip images so i could display them with the data.

Then i moved on to create a "Dark Mode" for the application since that is what was already used style wise.

I then created the Skip Card Component which i use to compile the data of the Skips into a readable and usable format.

After that was done i created the useSkips file that compiles the given skip data into data that is usable by the SkipCard component.

I then stated on the main project (where i already has the Dark Mode div tag). there i ensured I have a variable where the skip data is entered. by doing it this way it should be easy to change it to take the data from an API call.

I then added the code to select a skip and to display the skips according to the selection.

When the above was working i started on styling (I am not happy with the final look but I do not have the time to be extremely nitpicky with it currently)


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
